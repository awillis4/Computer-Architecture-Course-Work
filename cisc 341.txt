Week 1

Please answer any of the two questions review page 52-53 from the text by replying to this post.  You must try those questions no one has answered yet. Also, comment on one of the discussions from a fellow classmate.  A single word comment like "excellent" is not considered participation.  You can post your initial reaction to the reading/documentaries to provide an overview of something that struck you as interesting or disturbing in how responses related to a particular crisis covered were framed.
If you copy and paste your information from a website, you must site your findings.
 
REVIEW OF ESSENTIAL TERMS AND CONCEPTS
1.       What is the difference between computer organization and computer architecture?
2.       What is an ISA
… etc.

5. to what power does the prefix giga refer?

giga is equivalent to saying 1 billion and represents a billion of something.
nano is equivalent to saying 1 billionth and represents 1 billionth of something.

6. to what power does the prefix micro refer?

micro is the prefix for indicating 1 millionth of something.
macro, or mega indicates 1 million of something.

Practicality: wavelength is measured on many scales of 10, and it turns out that different colors
are produced when photons are spaced apart in nanometers, or billionths of a meter.

for example, the color purple, or indigo is produced at wavelengths of 402 to 417 billionths of 1 meter, or nanometers.

I know that week 1 also required an introduction, but i did not know where to post it.

Anyway, my name is Armani Willis, I am a Junior computer science major. 

My intrests and hobbies involve science, an in the future, i would like to give others the ability to practice science for free.

There are alot of people here that i did not expect to be here. This makes me wish that this class was a physical class.

Another reason is that i would have liked to be around these antique computer parts to learn how the bigger shallower computers became

modern computers.

A biased exponent is an exponent that is more or less than one used in a given computation. 
It is useful for making measuments of values in their original exponents. (Wolfram Mathematica)

16. What is normalization and why is it necessary?
Normalization is a restructuring of data to reduce redundancies. It is necessary for optimizing the speed of

5. What is the boolean duality principle?
0.0=0, 0.1=0, 0+0=0, 0+1=0, 1.1=1, 1+1=0
The boolean duality principle deals with concepts which are false if doubly true.
Therefore, it is an example of something that cant be true twice. for example, a pear cant be red and red, a flower cannot open and then be opened.
so even though its conditions can both be true, they cannot add each other.

Week 6, Chapter 7
10. Why does DMA require cycle stealing?
DMA stands for direct memory access. It requires cycle stealing when it accesses memory
while it is occupied with too many other functions to handle it directly.

27. How do optical discs store bytes?
optical discs store bytes by the spin states of the atoms in its magnetic tape. When this tape is being read, the magnetic pin reader, or laser registers its electrical impulses
from the reduction of the quantitity of its charge based on the spin state of the tape.

Week 7, Chaper 8 (Operating Systems)

7. How is a distributed operating system different from a networked operating system?
A distributed operating system is a distribution of a single computer along multiple pieces of discrete hardware. A networked operating system is a system of multiple computers sharing 
the same mainframe system.

17. What is an overlay? Why are overlays not needed in large computer systems?
Overlay is the process of dividing a file of whatever kind into chunks and allocating only needed sections of the file to memory. Overlays are not needed in large computer systems that can checkeach other's file space and registry for optimal process utility.

Week 8 (Midterms)

Week 9. 

1. Why do risc machines operate on registers?
risc machines operate on registers because they handle computation processes that must be stored in memory so that steps of the process can be completed.

11. What do simd and mimd stand for? How do they relate to each other?
(single,multiple);(multiple,data)streams are categories of data streams that a computer can process at a single time. in this case, single instruction single data means that this data stream
carries one instruction and has a single stream matrix. multi instruction multiple data streams carry many instructions with many parallel lines of data.

Week 11, Spring Break

Week 12.

15. Describe the steps involved in performing a context switch.

Context switching involves saving a process in a certain state, then switching to a 

different process. 

The program counter indicates the current process that is returned to the process control

block, then moves to either select a process from the priority queue, or to call the next

process in ready queue.

18. Describe how the operating system and the user program differ in their perception of a virtual machine.

The operating system is fixed and the virtual machine is a component onto the operating system, the user program may be moved between virtual machines on an operating system, but the virtual machines are also movable, whereas the host operating system is not;

Virtually run operating systems must still run off of the host operator when running user programs, user programs could also be virtual machines.

Week 13. 

2. What does Amhahl's law tell us about performance and optimization?

Amdahl's law depicts how Performance is optimized as a whole the more that performance is optimised for components of the whole.  S=[(1-p)+(p/s)]^-1

8. How is the Drhystone benchmark different from Whetstone and Linpack?

Drhystone benchmarks contain no floating point operations.

9. How are the 3 previous benchmarks inferior to SPEC CPU benchmarks?

SPEC CPU benchmarking is CPU intensive, and works with younger programming languages and more recent operating systems.

Week 14.

9. Explain the General purpose of the TCP Protocol.

The TCP Protocol was originally designed by CERN in the 1950s as a substandard model for unifying the connection protocols between multiple machines, and it allowed machines to be 
individually identifyable over the internet.
